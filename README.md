A web app built almost entirely using the **R** library for web development **Shiny**.
This project aims to help the user perform an analysis to determine which retention rate of a given growth medium is the most optimal for the growth of a given seed species.

# Notes
It's important to clarify that my work on this project is limited to the web logic of the app. All the analysis logic was developed by a colleague of mine.
